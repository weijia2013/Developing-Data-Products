## Introduction
This project is to utilise the sentiment analysis to understand passengers' dynamic attitude changes' toward TfL's bus service. You can learn more detailed information about [TfL](https://www.tfl.gov.uk/) by clicking on it.

Twitter provides potential opportunities for travellers to express their opinions towards their experienced issues during their journey. In the meantime, it also provide new opportunities for transport operators to learn from their passengers. However, only accounting for the numbers of Twitter followers cannot reveal how success of operators' Twitter performance. This project provide a noval method in transport domain for operators to understand their customers in a effective way.

Cluster analysis and sentiment analysis can not only help operators to investigate travellers' overall attitude changes towards their service, but also can understand opinions to a specific service, such as, bus reliability, driver behaviour and safety issues. Wordcloud can illustrate the reasons why passengers post that opinion.
